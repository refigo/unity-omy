  ### User Input

In Unity, I want to use joint_states ros2 message as urdf imported open_manipulator_y joints target. Please implement the script for that.

### Planner Response

To achieve this in Unity, you need a script that subscribes to the ROS2 `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` topic and applies the received joint positions to the corresponding URDF joints of your OpenManipulator-X (open_manipulator_y) robot.

Below is a step-by-step plan for the script:

1. **Subscribe to the `joint_states` topic** using a ROS2 bridge (e.g., Unity Robotics Hub ROS-TCP-Connector, or your own ROS2 C# client).
2. **Map the received joint names** to the corresponding Unity ArticulationBody or configurable joint objects imported from URDF.
3. **Update the joint targets** (e.g., drive target or position) in Unity based on the values from the ROS message.

Assumptions:
- You are using Unity’s ArticulationBody for URDF joints (default for URDF Importer).
- You already have the ROS2 connection set up (using Unity Robotics Hub or similar).
- The script will be attached to a GameObject in the scene.

Here’s a script template for this purpose:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Robotics.ROSTCPConnector;
using Unity.Robotics.ROSTCPConnector.MessageTypes.Sensor;
using UnityEngine.Articulation;

public class RosJointStatesSubscriber : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Tooltip("Root GameObject of the URDF robot")]
    public GameObject robotRoot;

    // Dictionary to map joint names to their ArticulationBody
    private Dictionary<string, ArticulationBody> jointNameToBody;

    void Start()
    {
        // Build joint name to ArticulationBody map
        jointNameToBody = new Dictionary<string, ArticulationBody>();
        foreach (var joint in robotRoot.GetComponentsInChildren<ArticulationBody>())
        {
            jointNameToBody[joint.name] = joint;
        }

        // Subscribe to joint_states
        ROSConnection.GetOrCreateInstance().Subscribe<JointStateMsg>(
            "/joint_states", JointStateChange);
    }

    void JointStateChange(JointStateMsg msg)
    {
        // For each joint in the message, set the corresponding ArticulationBody's target
        for (int i = 0; i < msg.name.Length; i++)
        {
            string jointName = msg.name[i];
            float position = (float)msg.position[i];

            if (jointNameToBody.TryGetValue(jointName, out ArticulationBody joint))
            {
                var drive = joint.xDrive;
                drive.target = position * Mathf.Rad2Deg; // URDF uses radians, Unity uses degrees
                joint.xDrive = drive;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**How to use:**
1. Attach this script to any GameObject in your scene.
2. Assign the `robotRoot` in the inspector to the root GameObject of your imported URDF robot.
3. Make sure your ROS-TCP-Connector is set up and running.

**Notes:**
- The script assumes the joint names in ROS match the names of the ArticulationBody components in Unity.
- If your URDF uses a different naming convention, you may need to adjust the mapping logic.
- The script sets the xDrive target, which is typical for revolute joints. For prismatic or other types, you may need to adapt the code.
